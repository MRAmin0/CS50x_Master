                <p>Aloy ends up winning the Proving, but the Nora are attacked by masked cultists immediately after.
                    <br>
                    This attack leads Aloy on a quest across the lands to not only learn the reason for the attack but
                    to find out more about where she truly came from. Along the way, Aloy uncovers how the civilization
                    of 'The Old Ones' fell and comes face to face with a threat that endangers the whole world.
                    <br>
                    The story of Horizon Zero Dawn (HZD) is a darn compelling one. The world, the lore and Aloy's
                    personal journey combine to create a narrative of success.
                    <br>
                    Aloy is a much better protagonist than I thought she would be given the genre. She's a very
                    well-written character who has a lot of depth. A character you can easily connect with and pull you
                    into the game's emotions making the feels hit that much harder. She's also, just like Geralt in the
                    Witcher 3, is a character that's a perfect fit for the game. Her inquisitiveness fits well with the
                    exploration and freedom the game offers you without breaking player immersion.
                    <br>
                    Ashley Burch's strong performance as Aloy helps tremendously in bringing the character to life.
                    Lance Reddick, who I think you know best as the concierge of the Continental in John Wick, also does
                    an excellent job as the methodical Sylens. The rest of the vocal performances are good though they
                    do lean more towards passable than believable at times.
                </p>

                <p>A lot of attention has been put into the world. The post-apocalyptic setting goes beyond the
                    tried-and-true dessert trope and sees a more varied bio-sphere. Mother Nature is back in full swing,
                    leading to a varied bio-sphere full of plains, jungles etc. If not for the clearly visible remnants
                    of the old world such as the metal frame of skyscrapers and a football stadium and the machines, you
                    wouldn't initially think it was a post-apocalyptic world. Neat.
                    <br>
                    The focus on the human element is noteworthy. The cultures and societal influences the Old world
                    has had on this new civilization, both big and small, are thought-provoking. From the whole
                    technology is seen as magic trope too far more interesting aspects. How humans mystify and
                    objectify things they don't understand, for example.
                    <br>
                    Time to go into the gameplay. HZD is, again, open-world. You can freely explore, doing everything
                    from stalking and hunting the machines to finding collectables to helping out the people through
                    tons of side-quests. The open-world nature of the game is both a strength and a weakness, depending
                    on what you seek in an open-world game.
                    <br>
                    The sense of exploration and discovery, especially the farther you get into the game and the better
                    your understanding of the world becomes, is excellent. The side-quests are plentiful and varied and
                    the collectables, loot and gear are fun to collect. The combat, which I'll dive into more later, is
                    satisfying. You can use skill points to invest in Aloy's skill tree and tailor her to your
                    playstyle. In short: the game does everything an open world should do and it does it well.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The potential weakness lies in how much you like the open-world formula. HZD offer very little
                    innovation. I don't think that a game not innovating on its formula is a bad thing but with the
                    uptick in the genre we've seen lately I can understand that people are growing tired of it. That
                    annoyances with certain aspects like, for instance, a map that is so cluttered with icons it becomes
                    difficult to read become more than just an annoyance.
                    <br>
                    The game's combat is very satisfying. Aloy is a hunter and the game does an excellent job of making
                    you truly feel like one. Running in bow blazing, even if you are double the level of the machine, is
                    not going to work out well for you. To take them down, you have to be smart about it. Use the game's
                    stealth mechanics to sneak up on a machine for a surprise attack or try and take them over. Use your
                    bows to snipe from afar and lay bare weak spots. Plant traps such as bombs in a machine's set path
                    etc.
                    <br>
                    The only issue here is the melee combat. It's sluggish, slow and difficult to aim. When fighting big
                    machines this is passable but when engaging human targets is more of a hassle than its worth. Better
                    stick with your bow and stealth tactics here as much as possible.
                    <br>
                    The most interesting gameplay, and UI, element is your Focus. This little device not only provides a
                    narrative justification for Aloy's ability to interact with Old Ones' technology. It seamlessly
                    marries the divide between UI elements with the narrative, the game's world. With the ability to
                    scan for data, reveal the path of machines and X-ray it's the best tool in your arsenal.

                <p>Time to wrap this review up. Performance-wise, the game runs like butter on the PS5. High fidelity
                    models and textures and the earlier mentioned world design add up to a very good looking game. My
                    only nit-pick here is the character models. Their movement is stiff and their facial animations
                    leave something to be desired.
                    <br>
                    The music is composed by Joris de Man, The Flight, Niels van der Leest, and Jonathan Williams, with
                    vocals by Julie Elven. It uses experimental instrumentation to create a score that combines
                    different styles of music to create the score. Cellos and guitars (amongst others) created the
                    tribal music while synthesizers and such were used for tracks about the machines. An interesting mix
                    that, thanks to the games world and the skill of artists involved, works wonders.
                    <br>
                <p>Conclusion</p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Horizon Zero Dawn is a darn good game. A well-crafted AAA open-world game that is thoroughly
                    enjoyable with its well-written narrative and breath-taking world. It's not the most innovative game
                    in the open-world genre but hey, nothing is perfect. This game is worth checking out if you haven't
                    already. For just 20,- SRP you can get the definitive edition, including some extra goodies and The
                    Frozen Wilds expansion so you really don't have to spend a lot of cash if you want to give the game
                    a go.
