                <p>God of War (2018) though? That game managed to sell that 4 to 5 million mark in its first month. At
                    the moment, it has moved over 23 million copies. With that kind of success and the game's two
                    stingers, a sequel just had to be made. That sequel is the still relatively new God of War Ragnarök.
                    <br>
                    Instead of opting for the traditional trilogy setup, Santa Monica studios decided to 'do it in two'.
                    To make the sequel the ending to the 'Norse Era' of the series. With how game development has
                    ballooned over the last decade, up to 5 years of work, the developers didn't want to drag the
                    narrative out over a 15-year period. This puts even more weight on Ragnarök's shoulders. To just not
                    be the follow-up to the smash hit and Game of the Year winning predecessor, but it gives players a
                    satisfying and epic conclusion to everything God of War (2018) set in motion.
                    <br>
                    Since, totally on brand for me, I'm months 'late' with this review I get that the entire 'review
                    boom' surrounding the game has since long died down. Even so, I want to review the game because I
                    find doing so fun to do.
                    With all of that said, let's dive into God of War Ragnarök, Sony's latest hit and see what it brings
                    to the table!
                    <br>
                    Years after Kratos and Atreus set out on their journey to scatter their wife and mother Faye's ashes
                    from the highest peak of the realm the two are back home, doing their best to survive Fimbulwinter.
                    With Fimbulwinter, the years-long winter that heralds Ragnarök; the prophesized war that foretells
                    the death of Odin, Thor, many of the Gods and the Nine Realms as a whole. After Kratos and Atreus
                    killed a number of Aesir gods; Odin's youngest son Baldur and Thor's sons Magni and Modi, they know
                    it's only a matter of time before the Gods come knocking at the door for retribution. Freya,
                    Baldur's mother, Odin's ex-wife and their former friend, already tries to kill Kratos every time
                    they step outside of their home's protective barrier.
                    <br>
                    After Thor and Odin indeed come knocking, Kratos learns that Atreus has been running off and
                    searching for Týr, the Norse God of War and another son of Odin that once tried to unite the realms
                    against his father but failed and is believed to be dead. The boy wants answers about his supposed
                    identity as Loki and is frustrated by his father's inaction about everything that's going on. Odin
                    offers the two a deal: stop looking for Týr and he'll forgive them for everything and leave them
                    alone. He'll even take care of Freya for them. Kratos declines and a battle ensues.
                </p>
                <img src="../Image/blog/GOWR/GOWR2.jpg" alt="">
                <p>After, unexpectedly, surving this encounter Kratos and Atreus, helped by with their dwarven friends,
                    the brothers Sindri and Brok, and Odin's former advisor; now decapitatied undead head Mimir, set out
                    to find Týr and hopefully get those answers.
                    <br>
                    The story of God of War Ragnarök is, just like its predecessor, excellent. It is bigger, longer (I
                    mean, it took me 3 paragraphs just to set it up compared to the one!) bolder and a lot more epic.
                    Compared to the quieter, shorter and more personal story of its predecessor it's quite a contrast.
                    In a good way; it makes the game feel appropriately grand. Less personal, yes, but with something
                    like 'Ragnarök' that wouldn't really fit. Plus: it's not like the characters are forgotten.
                    <br>
                    Where God of War 2018 was about Kratos learning Atreus to be a God and Atreus learning Kratos to be
                    human (again), Ragnarök has them learning what type of human and God they are when the other isn't
                    around. It also deepens its theme of parenthood as well as learning when to hang on to someone and
                    when to let go. The longer run time also means that the game can focus more on its side characters.
                    More time is spent on Freya and the Huldra Brothers leading to character development I didn't see
                    coming and wouldn't have worked so well if not for the great performances.
                    <br>
                    The only nitpick I have is the pacing. The game's director, Eric Williams, has said that doing a
                    duology instead of a trilogy meant that they had to adjust the story's pacing. They did just that
                    but it wasn't done without hiccups. In this case, it doesn't flow so well and there's no palpable
                    difference between a lot of time or only a little bit of it passing.
                    The gameplay is where God of War Ragnarök has the most growth over its predecessor. That game's
                    combat walked so that this one could run. It's the same as it was but more balanced and a lot
                    deeper.
                </p>
                <img src="../Image/blog/GOWR/GOWR3.jpg" alt="">
                <p>
                    God of War Ragnarök, is a cinematic action-adventure game with exploration and puzzle-solving
                    elements. You control Kratos in both combo-based combat and puzzle-based exploration in the
                    semi-open, corridor-designed, world. You chain together light and heavy attacks for combos while
                    using your shield to block/counter attacks if you don't feel like dodging. A solid system that, as
                    I've already stated, is much more expansive here than it was in its predecessor.
                    <br>
                    Firstly; Kratos' weapons have been rebalanced. The frosty Leviathan Axe, which you can still
                    satisfyingly throw and recall like MCU's Mjölnir, is your heavy hitter. Does the most damage but has
                    a limited range. Kratos' old fiery Blades of Chaos do less damage than before but are excellent at
                    crowd control. His, slight spoiler, new spear is tailored to fight flying and faraway enemies. All
                    three can be imbued with their element's power by pressing the triangle button and have gotten
                    reworked combos and skills. The biggest change in the latter is that certain skills can now be
                    upgraded and tailored to you're liking if you use that skill enough times. From increasing the
                    damage to how long it stuns enemies, just to name an example.
                    <br>
                    The shield Kratos wields has now been changed from more of a move to a fully-fledged weapon in its
                    own right. You can now equip different shields with different effects, like tanking damage to a
                    high-risk, high-reward block. You can now upgrade it as well as attach different rötunds that give
                    stat bonuses and secondary effects just like the axe and blade handles. Armours work much the same
                    as weapons. You find them, craft and upgrade them with resources you find and then equip them for
                    stat bonuses.
                    <br>
                    Much like you're runic special attacks, you can also equip attachments that give you special moves
                    regardless of weapon such as a burst of health. You also now have an amulet in which you equip
                    special runes for even further additional effects and modifications if you meet the conditions. Your
                    health slowly regenerating on its own is my favourite.
                </p>
                <img src="../Image/blog/GOWR/GOWR4.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Atreus is still here and still, you're ever faithful companion (when he and Kratos are together) that
                    acts as an extension of your move set. With his bow you can keep the pressure on the enemies, hit
                    targets from far away and summon some extra attacks to for great damage or more health. There's more
                    to Atreus and the companion slot but that's something I leave for you, the player, to discover.
                    All of these elements are what makes give more depth to the combat system. You can just go online,
                    look up people's playthroughs and streams of the game and see them have completely different combat
                    styles. There's a lot to experiment with and find a playstyle that suits you. Something high-risk,
                    high reward or something more defensive with more gracious timing, like me. Combine that with a lot
                    more varied enemy selection, and you get an approachable an very enjoyable combat system. Taking
                    down, let's say, a dragon is thrilling and rewarding.
                    <br>
                    When not in combat you're exploring the 9 realms. From Midgard, Earth, to the world of the Elves,
                    Alfheim, to many more. You travel across these realms, coming across ruins, long abandoned mines and
                    a lot more. Most of these places are set up as environmental puzzles. From finding hidden runes to
                    open a door to freezing gears to find your way through death traps with battles thrown in. Still,
                    nothing special here but it doesn't need to be as it's very entertaining.
                    <br>
                <p>Conclusion</p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    God of War Ragnarök is an improvement over the already excellent God of War (2018). It has a bigger,
                    more grand and epic story that brings the father-son story of Kratos and Atreus, and that of the
                    Norse Era, to a grand and emotional close. Its gameplay has been deepened and made a lot more
                    diverse and fun. From the rebalancing to new combos, weapons and extra layers of mechanics. It's not
                    perfect; but then what is? What matter is that it's well made and fun game. Add in the great
                    performances, graphics, soundtrack and accessibility options and you have one of the best
                    PlayStation games ever made, in my humble opinion at least.
