                <p>Since Crystal Dynamics was busy working on Marvel's Avengers, the games' developer this time around
                    is Eidos-Montr√©al with Crystal Dynamics only acting as a support studio.
                    <br>
                    Shadow of the Tomb Raider sees Lara's conflict with Trinity, the centuries-old shadow organization
                    responsible for killing her father and basically all the other big events in the trilogy, enter its
                    final stages. After she and her best friend and fellow Yamatai survivor Jonah spent the last few
                    months the time between this game and 'Rise of the Tomb Raider', hunting down Trinity cells they
                    finally come face to face with its leader: Dr Dominguez in Cozumel, Mexico.
                    <br>
                    They learn Dominguez is after some sort of relic hidden in a ruin Trinity found and Lara scrambles
                    to get it before they do. She succeeds but shortly after Dominguez confronts her and steals the
                    relic, a dagger, away from her. He's surprised to learn that Lara isn't in possession of the
                    dagger's other half, the 'Silver Box' that is needed to stop the curse that will 'destroy the world'
                    if the dagger is ever found.
                    <br>
                    A claim seemingly backed up by the earthquake that happened the moment and the tidal wave that tears
                    into Cozumel only moments after Dominguez leaves in a helicopter intend on finding the box and use
                    its power to 'reshape the world'.
                    It's a race against the clock to find the 'Silver Box', whispered to be hidden in a secret city in
                    Peru, and stop these natural disasters from tearing the world apart before Trinity can use it for
                    their own ends.
                    <br>
                    The narrative of Shadow of the Tomb Raider is weak. It's not outright bad but it has a lot of
                    issues. The biggest are pacing issues and a lack of depth. The game starts strong with the opening
                    action set piece you'd expect that introduces us to the main threat, our physical obstacle, as well
                    as setting up the growth Lara needs to do as a character. The problem is that it fails to bring both
                    to a satisfying conclusion. Dr Dominguez is absent for most of the game, only checking in once or
                    twice before the final stand against him begins. Lara's personal growth feels unearned because the
                    game doesn't do the work to make it feel earned. It doesn't feel like Lara becomes less selfish and
                    more considerate of the consequences of her actions because of personal growth but more because
                    that's simply what the plot demands of her.
                </p>
                <img src="../Image/blog/SOTR/SOTR2.jpg" alt="">
                <p>This makes the final battle, which isn't Laura fighting against an undead army this time around, fall
                    flat. A cool spectacle that lacks weight. That the middle part of the game can drag doesn't help
                    either. After the opening, it took until the halfway point for me to become invested again. To get
                    that drive back. That's not something you want in your game.
                    I will say that the game has some very strong moments in the story, especially in the 2nd half. They
                    look cool, are well performed and are well shot and with the context of the 2013 Tomb Raider and
                    'Rise' they really hit home.
                    <br>
                    What the game also nails is the atmosphere. Not just that of the Jungle, the differences in
                    settlements or the like. What I'm talking about is its eerieness. The survivor trilogy hasn't shied
                    away from that 'mature' rating with blood, violence and some twisted imagery. Shadow focuses more on
                    this aspect, sprinkling in some more horror elements here and there. It's not as claustrophobic as
                    the 2013 outing but it's a lot eerier and it works in establishing a more distinct identity,
                    something it does need.
                    <br>
                    The gameplay of 'Shadow' has remained unchanged from 'Rise'. For the combat, it's the standard
                    3rd-person aiming with a bow and guns with the option to hide behind obstacles, dodge and attack
                    enemies. You can go in guns blazing or use environmental elements such as exploding barrels and try
                    to sneak around and take down enemies using stealth techniques. This combat system is fine if still
                    shallow. Fun, but without any really meaningfull changes it's just as repetitive as before. There's
                    a skill system for you to tinker with but the combat-focused ones have minimal effect. Basic
                    shooting is enough to take down your enemies most of the time and that gets, again, repetitive. The
                    game missed a real opportunity here to evolve its combat and skill system.
                    <br>
                    It's good, then, that Shadow chooses to downplay combat encounters and focus its energy on other
                    departments: stealth and puzzle-solving. By giving you a lot more options when it comes to sneaking
                    your way around enemy encounters like hiding in overgrowth on buildings, placing explosives on
                    enemies take down and using mud to make you harder to see and cover up your heat signature, you now
                    have a lot more tools at your disposable to tackle enemy encounters the way you want. Clearing
                    sections without ever getting spotted is a puzzle in and of itself bringing that aspect out more
                    prominently beyond the tombs.
                </p>
                <img src="../Image/blog/SOTR/SOTR3.jpg" alt="">
                <p>
                    Your survival senses, which highlight interesting markers, are still an unmissable tool and still
                    overused. The next Tomb Raider game could really use more environmental storytelling and clues. I
                    rely on survival sense so much because it's difficult to find secrets and clues without it. Crafting
                    with gathered resources is still a thing but I didn't engage in it much this time around. Since it
                    mostly gives you combat bonuses and Vestige outfits, outfit attachment that gives you a variety of
                    perks, that aren't really needed, I didn't feel like my time was well spent there.
                    <br>
                    Exploration is also still a big focus. Yes, the game features really only three big areas that you
                    can freely explore (all others are smaller, linear sections for action set pieces) but it doesn't
                    feel limiting since each has plenty for you to do. It's safe to say that with Shadows we've entered
                    the puzzles are more prominent than combat. Like the old Tomb Raider games. The focus is even more
                    on the Tombs and puzzle solving than even Rise did. There are more Tombs, crypts, artefacts and
                    side-quests than there ever were in the Survivor Trilogy.
                    <br>
                    Said Tombs are great. They strike a good balance in length, complexity and fun. They are larger and
                    more complex but without feeling like they are overly complex or punishing. Some are your expected
                    'dark and damp underground places' while others put a more unique spin on their design like one
                    that's a big tower up in a mountain you have to get to the top of. With the DLCs, which also include
                    some fun side-quests and rewards, you have 16 to dig your teeth into. You can even replay these
                    Tombs and put your end score (based on speed) up on online leaderboards.
                    <br>
                    Staying in the Metroidvania course of offering upgrades that you can use to open up new areas and
                    paths in older areas, there is a ton of stuff for you to discover. From simple things like resources
                    and healing herbs to story-related tidbits to lore about Mayan culture and mythology to finding the
                    remains of an old expedition and learning its story there's a lot to find.
                    Or just to see: the ruins you can find are just as much a reward as the actual rewards themselves.
                    They can be awe-inspiring. The team did an excellent job creating these environments. From the more
                    play-by-play jungle itself to the beautiful, larger-than-life, temples, statues etc.
                </p>
                <img src="../Image/blog/SOTR/SOTR5.jpg" alt="">
                <p>That brings us to the final portion of this review: the graphics. In this department, it's hands down
                    the best entry in the survivor trilogy. Releasing well into the PS4's and Xbox One's life mean that
                    developers were much more familiar with these consoles. Knew the tricks to get things looking and
                    running very well. Well, for the former. In the latter department, there are a few hiccups here and
                    there like some janky movement of Lara when interacting with certain obstacles. Nothing big or
                    game-breaking but if you've played the other two instalments, Shadow is noticeably less polished in
                    this and basically ever aspect.
                <br>
                <p>Conclusion</p>
                </p>
                <p>    
                Shadow of the Tomb Raider is a very good game. It has the best graphics, environment and Tombs of the
                trilogy and is just a fun game to play. As you've probably already guessed though, it's not the greatest
                game. To circle back to the opening: now that I've played it I think that the game's more muted
                reception is a result of both Eidos not being as strong as a Tomb Raider developer and the lack of
                innovation on the formula making it grow stale. Still, a good pickup, especially these days were it is
                permanently on sale, but if you want a more balanced and polished Tomb Raider outing or want to play the
                'best' game in this trilogy I'd go with 'Rise of the Tomb Raider' and 'Tomb Raider (2013)' respectively
                over this one.
