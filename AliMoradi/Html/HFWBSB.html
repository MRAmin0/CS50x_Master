                <p>Not only that but many Quen have gone missing without a trace in recent weeks, including Sekya's
                    sister.
                    Figuring that the disappearance of The Quen and Londra's arrival is linked, Aloy and Seyka team up
                    to find the missing Quen and stop Londra.
                    <br>
                    The plot of Burning Shores is, as I expected, a smaller and more personal story. At its core, it's
                    not about the threat, but about Aloy and Seyka and their relationship/budding romance. Walter Londra
                    and everything he's up to is nothing we haven't seen before. I'd even call him a flat and stale
                    villain with a predictable bad-guy scheme. Least favourite villain in the series thus far, even with
                    Sam Witwer's performance. However: he does help tie up the Forbidden West/Far Zenith story up in a
                    satisfying way with some hints as to what is next.
                    <br>
                    This DLC put a large focus on Seyka. She gets to do the heavy lifting with the personal stakes: her
                    missing sister and the growing animosity from her tribe. I don't dislike her, she isn't a bad
                    character, but she's too similar to Aloy. Near identical inpersonality with lots of parallels in her
                    life story. Even before that interview came out, I realized this was intentional. Her drive and
                    skill are what initially catch Aloy's attention and later helps in forging a connection between the
                    two since Aloy has more or less stood where Seyka now stands, but still. She could've been more
                    distinct.
                    <br>
                    Speaking of Aloy, she gets some more character development here: falling in love for the first time
                    and everything that comes with that. The next step in opening herself up to others, you could say.
                    Ashley Burch does an exceptional job with portraying a love struck Aloy here. From the voice work to
                    her facial expressions to her body language. The narrative also highlights how Aloy has grown over
                    the course of the game. Some of the conversations she has with Seyka show how her attitude and
                    world-view has changed since she started her journey.
                    <br>
                    There's nothing ground breaking in the DLC's small narrative, but than again, it didn't have to. The
                    expectation was a smaller, more personal, story that just a fun ride for fans and that is what it
                    does. The things you have to do and the locations you visit are enjoyable. The strong lore building
                    and world design Guerilla has shown with this series is back on full display here. Plus; while the
                    narrative itself is small scale that final boss is anything but.

                <p>Speaking of that big boss, let's tackle what has been hanging over the expansion as a looming shadow:
                    Burning Shores is PS5 only. All those people who bought the game on the PS4 version are out of luck.
                    PS5 with PS4 version PS5 need to drop an extra 10,- on top of the 20,- asking price for that upgrade
                    path to play this DLC. The reason Sony and Guerilla gave for this is that they wouldn't have been
                    able to achieve their creative vision on the PS4.
                    <br>
                    I don't like cutting of part of the fan-base like this. I think that when you release multiple
                    version of a game it's not an unreasonable expectation from the consumer that any add-on content
                    releases for all versions. Especially if the game in question is just over a year old. I feel that
                    the decision was made more because Sony just wants to be done with the PS4 and, with that being the
                    case, Guerilla just cut loose with their ambition instead of the other way around.
                    <br>
                    That said, I am glad they got to cut loose. If they also had to make a PS4 version of the Burning
                    Shores, that Horus fight would not have happened. You wouldn't have the most awesome fight in the
                    entire series and that big bang to end the DLC, and by extension Horizon II, on. Just seeing that
                    entire behemoth at once with that story build-up, is such a goosebump getting moment. Performance
                    wise the DLC runs well. It had no problem rendering that big fight though I did encounter some
                    little snags here and there. Like grapping points just randomly floating in the air, for example.
                    <br>
                    One other complaint of mine lies in the amount of content Burning Shores offers. It's a bit lacking.
                    The main quests is longer and beefier, yes, and you have some more side-activities but the
                    side-quests take a hit. Down to three from nine. With Burning Shores focus on more environmental
                    activities ala Elden Ring and Breath of the Wild, this cuts into the time we get to spend with the
                    Quen. We don't get to interact with many of the Quen and thus don't really learn that much more
                    about them and that is a shame.
                </p>
                <img src="../Image/blog/HFWBS/HFWBS3.jpg" alt="">
                <p>
                    I've always said that if Burning Shores was around the same size as The Frozen Wilds I'd be happy
                    but that sadly not the case. I'd say that we have about 10% less, or 1.5-2 hours, of content here.
                    What we have here is a lot of fun, but I would've liked more.
                    <br>
                    Design wise, the Burning Shores is a well realized location. The justaposition of the volcanic
                    activity with the beautifull beaches, ocean and skycrapper ruins that reach into the sky make the
                    location a treat to explore and just to see. Bit dissapointing though that stuff like the new cloud
                    tech and even more details texturesdoesn't carry over to the Forbidden West though. The Burning
                    Shores are not connected to the Forbidden West, just so you know. It has a seperate map with its own
                    loadingscreen to enter and exit.
                    <br>
                    For the gameplay and activities we don't really have any changes. We got some new skills and some
                    new weapons. Not any game changing additions but fun additions nonetheless. Some new Quen armour and
                    face paint. Some new machine types to fight. Some activities that you can do with your flying mount.
                    Fun stuff, but nothing that is unexpected or game changing.

                <p>Conclusion</p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    While not sporting quite the amount of content as I would've liked, Burning Shores is still a great,
                    and above all else, enjoyable expanssion that gives what it promised. It's a fun ride with some neat
                    character development for Aloy in a wel-realized location capped off by an epic final boss. The
                    highlight of the entire package. The PS5 exlusivity is a let down but for those Horizon Forbidden
                    West holders who can play it, it's a more than worthewile and fair-priced addition to the game.
