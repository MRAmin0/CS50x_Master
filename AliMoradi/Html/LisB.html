                <p>This 5 episode adventure follows the story of Max Caulfield and her troubled friend Chloe as they
                    investigate the disappearance of a fellow student at their school.
                    <br>
                    The hand drawn art style and interesting reversing time mechanics help to elevate Life Is Strange
                    above others in this genre with a well paced, emotional story at its heart. Although the game does
                    suffer from a bit of fatigue with unnecessary padding late on and some awkward sections that don't
                    fit with the story, Life Is Strange still manages to impress.
                    <br>
                    Set in the fictional town of Arcadia Bay, the story follows senior student Max who returns to the
                    town after a 5 year absence and finds herself reunited with childhood friend Chloe. Together, they
                    investigate the disappearance of student Rachel Amber, and try to find out exactly what happened to
                    her. The story itself does do a pretty good job of building the relationship between Max and Chloe
                    whom the plot gravitates around. The slow pace the game adopts for vast periods of the play time
                    helps to deepen the character relationships too and on the whole, it definitely achieves this.
                    <br>
                    Along with likeable, believably written characters, the game world is full of interesting settings
                    too. The bright colours and unique art style really complement Max's quirky personality and although
                    the areas themselves are linear and relatively small in their design, there's enough side content
                    packed into these areas to still make it enjoyable to traverse through. The weight of the choices
                    given at key moments of the emotionally charged narrative are surprisingly powerful as well,
                    although the final choice of the game boils down to a singular binary choice akin to that of Mass
                    Effect 3 which is a bit of a shame. Despite this, the story is decent enough that you can forgive
                    the ending given how good the rest of the game is.
                    <br>

                <p>Gameplay wise, Life Is Strange plays out much the same way as others in this genre. Lengthy cut
                    scenes with some quick time events prompting a specific button press are broken up by slightly
                    longer playable sections set in the game world. Its here that the third person perspective take full
                    advantage of Life Is Strange's unique gameplay mechanic rewinding time. After an accident occurs
                    that grants Max these powers, the ability to rewind time at key moments of the story does make for
                    some interesting and oftentimes clever developments to occur.
                    <br>
                    In doing this, it is a bit of a double edged sword at times as it negates some of the tension during
                    key choices, knowing you could theoretically just rewind time again. Life Is Strange does do a good
                    job of showing the consequences of these actions though with a few well placed surprises through the
                    adventure.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <img src="../Image/blog/LIS/Lis3.jpg" alt="">
                <p>
                    Ultimately, Life Is Strange is all about the story. There's some interesting themes around loss,
                    regret and choice explored in scrutinous detail throughout the 5 episode adventure and although some
                    of the design choices are a little questionable, Life Is Strange does a good job of telling a
                    cohesive story throughout its run time.
                    <br>
                    The characters of Life is Strange make the game so special, somewhat comparable to Clementine from
                    The Walking Dead. I can't imagine that anyone can't be a fan of Max's cute shyness and the tough but
                    gentle Chloe. The vibe between these two girls is so powerful that it has had a lasting impact on me
                    since 2015. To experience all of that again with the enhancements Deck Nine has done is just a
                    godsend. It goes without saying that Max and Chloe are memorable but the supporting characters are
                    great too. And since Before the Storm is included you have the full story and experience in one
                    package.
                    <br>
                    Alt-J and many more incredible music gives extra emotional punch. Songs kick in perfectly giving you
                    goosebumps or seem to do some magical things to make your eyes cry. Life is Strange doesn't shy away
                    from allowing music to get some spotlight. Voice-acting can be described very well in one sentence.
                    'Best voice-acting in the gaming world' Voice actors Hanne Telle (Max), Ashly Burch (Chloe) and
                    Kylie Brown (Rachel) do fantastic performances. I do have to note that Chloe is voiced by someone
                    else in Before the Storm though, a small bummer.
                    <br>
                    Life is Strange's gameplay is especially special with choosing conversation options, Max has special
                    powers that she can go back in time. So you can take different paths to reach your goal.
                    Furthermore, you explore the environments in a third-person view to solve puzzles and interact with
                    the environment. Each chapter is full of collectibles, adding replay value. There isn't any real
                    action so it is a pretty chill game without much pressure.
                </p>

                <p>As Chloe would say, Life is Strange is hella good! So there isn't anything bad I can say. Or wait…
                    there is one small change I noticed. More short loading screens have been added, a bit weird
                    considering I was playing on the Xbox Series X. They only take a split second, not entirely sure why
                    this happens though. There is even a disappointed Tweet from an original DONTNOD developer about
                    this. Seems that they spend many nights making sure that some scenes didn't have loading screens on
                    the PS3 and Xbox 360, so I understand how frustrating it must be to see this happen on stronger and
                    much faster consoles.
                    <br>
                <p>Conclusion</p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    An essential purchase. That pretty much sums up Life is Strange Remastered Collection. Memorable
                    characters in an unpredictable and emotional story. I would be thrilled if Men in Black's Neuralyzer
                    would be real so I could replay this game over and over again.
